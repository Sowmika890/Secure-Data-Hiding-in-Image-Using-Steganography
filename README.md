1.Overview

This project implements image-based steganography, allowing users to securely hide and extract secret messages within images. The hidden data can only be retrieved with the correct passcode, ensuring confidentiality.

2.Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV (image processing), NumPy (data handling), OS (file management)

Platforms: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

3.Features

Hide secret messages inside images without altering their appearance.

Password-protected decryption for enhanced security.

Works with common image formats (JPG, PNG, JFIF).

Simple and lightweight implementation.

4.Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Sowmika890/Secure-Data-Hiding-in-Image-Using-Steganography

Install dependencies:

pip install opencv-python numpy

Run the encryption script:

python encrypt.py

Run the decryption script:

python decrypt.py

5.Use Cases

Secure communication for military and intelligence operations.

Concealing sensitive data in everyday images.

Privacy-focused messaging without suspicion.
